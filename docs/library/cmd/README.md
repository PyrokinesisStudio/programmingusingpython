> The Cmd class provides a simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreters. These are often useful for test harnesses, administrative tools, and prototypes that will later be wrapped in a more sophisticated interface.

> A Cmd instance or subclass instance is a line-oriented interpreter framework.

> There is no good reason to instantiate Cmd itself; rather, it’s useful as a superclass of an interpreter class you define yourself in order to inherit Cmd‘s methods and encapsulate action methods.

Type:           module
Base Class:     <type 'module'>
String Form:    <module 'cmd' from '/usr/lib64/python2.6/cmd.pyc'>
Namespace:      Interactive
File:           /usr/lib64/python2.6/cmd.py
Docstring:
    A generic class to build line-oriented command interpreters.

    Interpreters constructed with this class obey the following conventions:

    1. End of file on input is processed as the command 'EOF'.
    2. A command is parsed out of each line by collecting the prefix composed
       of characters in the identchars member.
    3. A command `foo' is dispatched to a method 'do_foo()'; the do_ method
       is passed a single argument consisting of the remainder of the line.
    4. Typing an empty line repeats the last command.  (Actually, it calls the
       method `emptyline', which may be overridden in a subclass.)
    5. There is a predefined `help' method.  Given an argument `topic', it
       calls the command `help_topic'.  With no arguments, it lists all topics
       with defined help_ functions, broken into up to three topics; documented
       commands, miscellaneous help topics, and undocumented commands.
    6. The command '?' is a synonym for `help'.  The command '!' is a synonym
       for `shell', if a do_shell method exists.
    7. If completion is enabled, completing commands will be done automatically,
       and completing of commands args is done by calling complete_foo() with
       arguments text, line, begidx, endidx.  text is string we are matching
       against, all returned matches must begin with it.  line is the current
       input line (lstripped), begidx and endidx are the beginning and end
       indexes of the text being matched, which could be used to provide
       different completion depending upon which position the argument is in.

    The `default' method may be overridden to intercept commands for which there
    is no do_ method.

    The `completedefault' method may be overridden to intercept completions for
    commands that have no complete_ method.

    The data member `self.ruler' sets the character used to draw separator lines
    in the help messages.  If empty, no ruler line is drawn.  It defaults to "=".

    If the value of `self.intro' is nonempty when the cmdloop method is called,
    it is printed out on interpreter startup.  This value may be overridden
    via an optional argument to the cmdloop() method.

    The data members `self.doc_header', `self.misc_header', and
    `self.undoc_header' set the headers used for the help function's
    listings of documented functions, miscellaneous topics, and undocumented
    functions respectively.

    These interpreters use raw_input; thus, if the readline module is loaded,
    they automatically support Emacs-like command history and editing features.
