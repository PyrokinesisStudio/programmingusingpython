> class list([iterable])

Lists may be constructed in several ways:

* Using a pair of square brackets to denote the empty list: []
* Using square brackets, separating items with commas: [a], [a, b, c]
* Using a list comprehension: [x for x in iterable]
* Using the type constructor: list() or list(iterable)

The constructor builds a list whose items are the same and in the same order as iterableâ€˜s items. iterable may be either a sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable is already a list, a copy is made and returned, similar to iterable[:]. For example, list('abc') returns ['a', 'b', 'c'] and list( (1, 2, 3) ) returns [1, 2, 3]. If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list, [].

Many other operations also produce lists, including the sorted() built-in.

Lists implement all of the common and mutable sequence operations.
