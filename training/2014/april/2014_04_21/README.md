In this session we are going to take a look at the process of solving a problem by using Object Oriented Programming techniques using Python.

The default turtle object that we create using the turtle.Turtle class has certain behavior.

The behavior that we would like to bestow upon it is the following
By default when the turtle.Turtle object is created, it will be black in color (default)
Our turtle object will remember if it has been clicked or not
By default it is not clicked
If it was clicked, it will turn "green" else "red"
